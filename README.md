## Introduction
Hello, my name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitor-tokunaga-82b344278/">Vitor Tokunaga</a>, currently a Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.fecap.br/">FECAP</a>.
My interest in programming was sparked by the ease that technology can provide, automating complicated processes. This became clearer to me when I automated some sales spreadsheets from Excel using VBA for my parents.
